                            To secure a medical appointment, we may require a deposit of 200 USD or EUR, depending on
                            the currency of the quotation. This is communicated to you before confirming an appointment.
                            While the deposit is a service fee to Adam Vacations, the medical facility will deduct this
                            from your final treatment bill.
                            <br> <br>
